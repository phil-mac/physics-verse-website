<h1> Physics Verse </h1>
    
<p>
  This project's goal is to prototype a virtual-reality game where players discover and practice an introductory physics curriculum. 
    The game is being designed for PC-based VR where players learn by doing,
    and with multiplayer capability to facilitate collaboration with peers and teachers.

Notes:
start with statement that it would be a good thing for the world if more people learned science
phrase it that the game provides conditions in which players can learn physics
